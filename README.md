# i_am_rich
This project is inspired from :

The "I Am Rich" app is a famous (and often parodied) mobile application originally created for iOS by Armin Heinrich. 
It served no functional purpose other than displaying a glowing red gem on the screen and an affirmation that the user is rich. 
Its primary purpose was to make a bold, ironic statement about wealth and luxury, as it was priced at $999.99.

## Goal
To Create an app similar to "I Am Rich" Inspired from Armin Heinrich"
